# Compspec Go

This is early documentation that will be converted eventually to something prettier. Read more about:

 - [Design](design.md) of compspec
 - [Usage](usage.md) generic use cases
 - [Rainbow](rainbow.md) use cases and examples for the rainbow scheduler

## Thanks and Previous Art

- I learned about kernel parsing from [mfranczy/compat](https://github.com/mfranczy/compat)
- The graph design is based on the (now archived) [kraph](https://github.com/milosgajdos/kraph), released under Apache-2
